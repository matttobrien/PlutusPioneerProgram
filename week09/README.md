## Overview
The lecture this week focused on Marlowe, a new language for financial contracts, which is a domain-specific language (DSL). As a DSL it describes only financial contracts, rather than smart contracts in general. Marlowe is a platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) that supports direct, peer-to-peer lending, contracts for difference (CFD), and other similar instruments. It aims to make it extremely easy for anyone to create financial applications.

## Homework
The goal for this weeks homework was t modify the example Marlowe contract, so that Charlie must put down twice the deposit in the very beginning, which gets split between Alice and Bob if Charlie refuses to make his choice.
